# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, following best practices for project structure and version control.
# Details:
Use `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript` to scaffold the project. Install Tailwind CSS v3.4.3+ and configure it. Initialize a Git repository and set up a `.gitignore` file. Add basic README and project documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project creation by running `npm run dev` and checking for a working Next.js starter page. Confirm Tailwind CSS is applied by adding a test class.
